## My process
Using HTML i created three div's; oen as the containing div, another for the QR-code picture and the last for the write up. I also added a footer. 
Next i used CSS to set the styles of the various div's. Taking advantage of the different properties in CSS i was able to arrange the different elements on the webpage. I also made use of media query to make the page a little responsive, however i was unable to make the QR-code responsive. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Query


### What I learned
Through this project i was able to understand better how the position property(absolute and relative) work and theri different areas of application. Also how to manipulate web responsiveness using media qureies. I also saw how to check for a weboage responsiveness by using the chrome developer tools. 
'''
css
.atribute{position:relative;top: 25px} <!--Using positon property-->
.word {position:absolute; top:225px} 
@media (max-width:870) {footer{font-size:15px}}
'''

### Continued development
I would like to keep improving on making webpages responsive and designing more user friendly and appealing websites

### Useful resources
